# Celcius to Fahrenheit Converter
 A simple JavaScript exercise in arithmetic and event listeners

 ## Idea
 I came across this idea while studying some text unrelated to web development for school. Within the text there was a formula for the celcius to fahrenheit conversion. Thus, I thought it would be fun to create this into a static website and test my JavaScript abilities.

 ## What I Learned
 This exercise was a helpful reminder to use the "input" event in the addEventListener() method.

 Additionally, I learned I must use the .value property of HTML elements in order to perform calculations, such as the celcius to fahrenheit arithmetic.
